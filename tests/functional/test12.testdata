CaseDescription="Check that selective compositing works in most important cases.

- Test steps
	- start test app
	- check that test app is not composited
        - show an input window transient for the test app
        - check that test app is composited but the input window is not
        - unmap the input window
        - check that test app is not composited
        - map a new input window and set the transiency after mapping
        - check that test app is composited but the input window is not
        - remove transiency and lower the input window
        - check that test app is not composited
        - set the input window transient again
        - check that test app is composited but the input window is not
	- show a normal (non-fullscreen) application window
	- check that application is composited (due to the decorator)
	- iconify the application by raising desktop
	- check that desktop is not composited
        - show a meegotouch-looking window
        - try to close it before the animation ends
        - check that desktop is not composited
	- show a non-decorated RGBA application window
        - check that compositing is on (because the topmost window is RGBA)
        - set _MEEGOTOUCH_OPAQUE_WINDOW=1 on it
        - check that compositing is off
        - set _MEEGOTOUCH_OPAQUE_WINDOW=0 on it
        - check that compositing is on (because the topmost window is RGBA)
        - unmap it, set _MEEGOTOUCH_OPAQUE_WINDOW=1, then re-map
- Post-conditions
	- check that compositing is off\n"
