<h1>Splash Screens </h1>  </div>
</div>
<div class="contents">
<p>MCompositor supports so-called splash screens, which are images that are shown on start-up of an application before the real window of the application is shown.</p>
<p>A splash screen is an image file (JPEG preferred for fast loading; PNG is also supported) whose path and the application's process ID is told to MCompositor.</p>
<p>MCompositor shows the splash screen when a special window property _MEEGO_SPLASH_SCREEN is set to MCompositor's _NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK window. The window property has type XA_STRING and the value contains five NUL-terminated strings. The meaning of the strings is documented in the following table.</p>
<table  border="1">
<tr>
<th>1st string </th><th>2nd string </th><th>3rd string </th><th>4th string </th><th>5th string  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td>PID of the app </td><td>WM_CLASS (ignored) </td><td>Path to portrait image </td><td>Path to landscape image </td><td>Pixmap ID  </td></tr>
</table>
<p>The mandatory strings are the PID (process ID) and path to the portrait image, or the PID and a pixmap ID. If the pixmap ID is provided, that pixmap is used as the splash screen instead of loading any image file. If the landscape image is missing, the portrait image is used also in the landscape orientation. The dimensions of both portrait and landscape images should be the same &lt;screen width&gt; X &lt;screen height&gt;; i.e. MCompositor does not rotate the splash image, it should be drawn rotated. The splash image is stretched to full screen size if the image is smaller than the size of the screen.</p>
<p>The splash screen is closed when a window with _NET_WM_PID of the same value as the first string appears, or when the timeout of splash-timeout-ms (in mcompositor.conf) is reached.</p>
<p>There is a command line utility manual-splash in the mcompositor-utils package that can be used to set the _MEEGO_SPLASH_SCREEN window property and as example code. </p>
